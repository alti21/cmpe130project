External Sorting Algorithm in Java
By Altemush Bhatti and Chastin Gammage

JAVA program to implement external sorting using MERGE-SORT an example of an External-memory sorting algorithm.
In MERGE-SORT, the file to be sorted is broke up into smaller blocks and then these blocks are seperately sorted 
and then the sorted blocks are merged together.
External memory sorting algorithm is called "external" as in the sorting is done exterenal to the processing unit. 
External memory sorting algorithms has high cost of accessing an item.
There are several restrictions to access the data depending on the external storage medium used. 
For example, magnetic tape can access data only in a sequential manner.
Alternatively, internal memory sorting algorithm where locality of reference is present works well 
in virtual memory system, for example, Quick Sort. Internal memory sorting algorithms can cause severe problems in
sorting disk files in a virtual-memory system.


ExternalSort.java is the source file
ExternalSort.class is the compiled java code used to run the source code
input.txt is input file that is generated by the source file
temp-file-# files are the temporary files that are generated when program is run. It is used to sort data.
sorted.txt is output file with sorted data
Sample Error picture shows error when you attempt to sort input file with too many values, if not done externally
